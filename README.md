# Group PROJECT 
Husky ADAPT repo: Hello! We are Sarthak, Ellani, and Jessy: Team EasyType. Our goal this year is to design a one-handed keyboard, specifically for Queso - a smart third grader who is a Minecraft expert. Here we will document our progress and interesting ideas we find along the way. Stay tuned!
